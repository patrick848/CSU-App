    <string name="map_filler">This is just a large, ugly ListView
        of all of the unique places on campus.  Clicking on one pulls
        up a crappy old Google Maps API view.  I WANT IT BEAUTIFUL!</string>
    <string name="news_filler">Again another ugly ListView, but it\'s parsed 
        from somewhere online which is cool, but clicking an article
        opens up the browser to it, instead of bringing the data
        to you.</string>

        and a play/pause button for the fight song to be played.</string>

	    bring you to the old Google Maps view of them.</string>
