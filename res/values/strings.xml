    <string name="four_filler">This has information about Campus 411,
        Such as a map button and a call button, which
        currently starts a call but should instead get a call ready.</string>
    <string name="map_filler">This is just a large, ugly ListView
        of all of the unique places on campus.  Clicking on one pulls
        up a crappy old Google Maps API view.  I WANT IT BEAUTIFUL!</string>
    <string name="news_filler">Again another ugly ListView, but it\'s parsed 
        from somewhere online which is cool, but clicking an article
        opens up the browser to it, instead of bringing the data
        to you.</string>
    <string name="fight_filler">The lyrics to the "The Pride of Cleveland"
        and a play/pause button for the fight song to be played.</string>
    <string name="tech_filler">ListView of tech related things, 
        and some buttons withing those things.</string>
    <string name="dining_filler">ListView of dining locations.  All 
        items bring you to websites of places, which isn\'t a 
        terrible idea.</string>
	<string name="parking_filler">ListView of parking garages, when clicked 
	    bring you to the old Google Maps view of them.</string>
	<string name="social_filler">Page of text with links to all of
	     their social network accounts.</string>
